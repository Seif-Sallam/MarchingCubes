# Marching Cubes in 2D

This is a small project that implements a classic generation algorithm called Marching Cubes, or Marching Squares when done in 2D.

It is essentially a simple algorithm that addresses a grid based world square by square where it starts partitioning the ON and OFF points of the grid.

There are different variants of the algorithm that solve some of the problems of the traditional algorithm.
